                        The Task: Create a 
                        non-electrical toy that would teach a child addition 
                        and subtraction using Solidworks. 

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Our design consisted of laser cut wood and 3D printed 
                        elements that would hold a double sided answer sheet. 
                        A child could move the sliders to highlight an equation 
                        of their choice and the two sliders would outline the 
                        correct answer in the center. This answer sheet could 
                        be removed and flipped over to display answers for 
                        subtraction equations. We were directed to focus on 
                        the computational side of addition and subtraction 
                        rather than counting/physical side and we were 
                        challenged with making the toy “self checking”.
