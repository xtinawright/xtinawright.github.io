               This class focuses on using software to create files for 
               manufacturing. We make software that can output 
               parameterized files with user inputs or small changes to the code.

                        The Task: Write a program with python that creates a SVG for a desk organizer
                        that is the size of user specified inputs. 

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        To generate a model a user first inputs the desired length, width, height, desired text, 
                        number of trays. I have calculations to
                         determine whether the these values will produce a functioning piece and fit on a give piece of acrylic. 
                         Error handling will prompt the user to enter values until a functional piece can be created. 
    
                        <br><br>From there, I used a collection of nested functions to build my pieces. Since I was creating a lot of repeated geometry I made functions for elements 
                        like the nut-screw holes. One of the most important parts of my code was using relative
                         paths with inputs for the starting x and y values. This allows me to easily reuse and move elements as I needed 
                         them to build my design. In the write functions to create the svg, I called the outermost functions, the actual
                          panels, which returned strings written in SVG style and arranged them. 
                        <br><br>I created five unique panels, the front/back panel, the side panel, the bottom panel, the lid and the handle. 
                        I wanted each tray to have the same pieces with different sizes so they looked uniform and could stack in orientation.
