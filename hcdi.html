            <h3>The task: Improve the experience of people working in New York City. 
            </h3>
            <p>For Human Centered Design taught by Harry West, my group and I came up with LumiNY to improve the experience of 
            riding the subway at night. We started by investigating problem territories for life in New York City. Then, we
            conducted interviews members of our customer base. We developed solutions using insights we gathered from research and interviews.
            Eventually, we developed prototypes to get further customer feedback and made changes to our idea. We also got 
            feedback from the rest of the class and further built out our product pitch.</p>

        <h3>Our Pitch</h3>   
        <p> 
            Over 60% of New Yorkers feel unsafe while riding the subway late at night, 
            especially when riding alone. However, the actual chance of getting injured 
            while taking the subway is less than 1% for every million subway rides â€“ how 
            can we get the experience to match with the numbers? LumiNY is a new lighting 
            system for New York subway stations that brings people together to help them feel safer. 
            LumiNY activates 10pm-6am, and is a two part system: increased ambient lighting 
            in the station helps people to feel more comfortable, and directive lights encourage 
            riders to congregate in certain areas on the platform, reducing isolation. 
            With LumiNY, the 30% of NYC who need to take the subway at night will have a safer, more positive experience.
