                    Earth Orbit.
                </h3>
                <p>Our team is working with NASA Jet 
                    Propulsion Laboratory to design this mechanism. We plan to target objects
                    with a diameter of 10-30 centimeters. This will allow us to
                    build a full sized mechanism with the alloted time and resources. Also, there is no work is being done to capture objects of this size. 
                    Currently, we are building rough protoypes to determine geometry for our mechanism. </p>

        The first mechanism is made up of articulated petals that 
        will actuate together. We want these petals to first open into 
        a funnel that will envelope an object. Then the petals will fold
        in and contain the object. There is an aperature leading 
        to the storage area that will open as the petals compress and 
        push the debris into storage. We are planning for the petals to have
        a large number of joints to add more degrees of freedom in the motion from
        a single acutation.
